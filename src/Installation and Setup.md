2. Create a new virtual machine:
   - Set the operating system type to **Linux** and version to **Debian (64-bit)**.
   - Allocate at least 2 processors and 4 GB of RAM.
   - Create a virtual hard disk with at least 20 GB of storage.
3. Attach the Kali Linux ISO or import the pre-built VM image.
4. Start the virtual machine and follow the on-screen installation prompts:
   - Select language, time zone, and keyboard layout.
   - Create a user account and set a password.

## 5Ô∏è‚É£ Troubleshooting Common Issues

- **Slow Virtual Machine Performance**:  
  Allocate more RAM and processors to the VM in your virtualization software settings.
  
- **Missing Tools**:  
  Some tools may not be pre-installed. Use the following command to install missing tools:
  ```bash
  sudo apt install kali-tools-top10
  ```
